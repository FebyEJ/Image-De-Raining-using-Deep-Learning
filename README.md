# Image-De-Raining-using-Deep-Learning

**Abstarct**
Rain streaks can blur or distort images, making them visually unappealing or difficult to interpret. Deraining can improve the accuracy and reliability of decision-making systems by providing clear visuals in rainy weather. Rain streak removal can lead to a 25% improvement in object detection accuracy under rainy conditions for surveillance systems and autonomous vehicles. Image Deraining has significance in critical applications, where visibility is critical such as Surveillance applications, Autonomous vehicles, Traffic management, Photography and photo editing, and Satellite imaging.

Given the benchmark dataset of  Rain100H, Rain100L, Test100, Test1200, Test2800 (https://github.com/swz30/MPRNet/blob/main/Deraining/Datasets/README.md, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivakanthsujit/jrdr-deraining-dataset), this project does the following:
 * Give a denoised (de-rained) high-quality image from an input rainy image.
 * Train, validate, test, and evaluate the architectures using metrics: MSE, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
 * We implement our project using CNN, GAN, and a hybrid of CNN and GAN to analyze and compare the performance metrics of each model with each other.

 The technology stack proposed:
 * Front End: using online platforms like Wix/WordPress/Google Sites
 * Back end: Python
 * Framework (Platform): Streamlit , Google Colab
 * Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Keras
 * Language with Version: Python 3.x (latest stable version)
