# Image-De-Raining-using-Deep-Learning

**Abstarct**
Given the benchmark dataset of  Rain100H, Rain100L, Test100, Test1200, Test2800 (https://github.com/swz30/MPRNet/blob/main/Deraining/Datasets/README.md, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivakanthsujit/jrdr-deraining-dataset) the system (web) does the following:
 * Give a denoised (de-rained) high-quality image from an input rainy image.
 * Train, validate, test, and evaluate the architectures using metrics: MSE, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
